create a new project: npx tsdx create newlib
then delete newlib/node_modules
then in root run npm install

don't install any other project, just import it.

for changes to a project to appear in one which depends on it, rebuild the project then restart the extension host
similarly for npm installs to affect auto error checking, restart the extension host

rebuilding a package while React running will break with compilation error, needs to restart

publish:
ensure any workspace dependencies are changed to registry package dependencies -
 npm i <registry package dep> -w <workspace>
 restart the extension host to fix VS code errors
update version
npm login
cd <package>
npm run build
npm publish --access public
